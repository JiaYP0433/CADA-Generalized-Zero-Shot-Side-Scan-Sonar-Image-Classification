# CADA Generalized Zero Shot Side Scan Sonar Image Classification
We propose Contrastive Adaptation of Domain Augmentation (CADA), a novel learning paradigm that utilizes background fusion and noise modeling to expand generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL), offering greater practicality in engineering.

### Requirements
