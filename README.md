# CADA-Generalized-Zero-Shot-Side-Scan-Sonar-Image-Classification
We propose Contrastive Adaptation of Domain Augmentation (CADA), a novel learning paradigm that utilizes background fusion and noise modeling to expand generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL), offering greater practicality in engineering.
